**How to Use rAIhan**

First, dm me at ThamThilly#9771 for the private_key.json that will be necessary for the dialogflow to work. I don't want to put this up publicly due to security reasons.

To be continued after I make this repo more finalized.

Just dm me at ThamThilly#9771 for help using this.

Thank you to NathanRLiu by helping a lot with the Discord backend so I can do the fun stuff :)
